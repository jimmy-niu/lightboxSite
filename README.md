This is an in-progress website. Written during winter break 2017-2018. 

As of now, there is not much useful information. Expect that to be updated before 2/5/2018.
Cosmetic fixes, as well as mobile support, will also come at that time. 

This website was done with information gleaned from freeCodeCamp as well as googling on my own. A large amount of this website was
written while on a plane or in the wee hours of morning in my grandma's house. Hope it doesn't show. 

All of the design will go into the gutter at some point. That will be the large overhaul at the beginning of the summer (2018).

Any feedback can be sent to the info in the contact page or chenenniu@gmail.com. Thanks for reading!
